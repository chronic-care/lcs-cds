Phase II work for LCS content:

* Update the content to the latest version of CPG
* Publish the content on fhir.org/guides
* Publish the content in CDS Connect

Also, it’s likely the following will change in the near future:
- URL reference to the USPSTF guideline (it’s being updated now -- https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft-update-summary/lung-cancer-screening1)
- 30 pack year requirement à 20 pack year requirement
- 55-80 age requirement à 50-80 age requirement

Provide internal documentation on how these changes would be made
